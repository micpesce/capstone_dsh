The site "https://github.com/micpesce/capstone_dsh" contains the following:


movielens.R   (uploaded to edx for evaluing by peers)
movielens.pdf (uploaded to edx for evaluing by peers)
movielens.rmd (uploaded to edx for evaluing by peers)
model_knn.rds
predict_knn.rds
regUI.rds
rmses.rds
summary_movielens.rds
capstone.Rproj

movielens.pdf has been generated by movielens.rmd knit

All the five *.rds files could be downloaded from peers.
This files are made for fast running and rendering movielens.pdf from movielens.rmd knit
The peers have also the chance to:
 - load a workspace containing the movielens, edx, and  valutation dataframes
 - run the chunks in the rmd file by removing "eval=FALSE",
but this will take long time running.
